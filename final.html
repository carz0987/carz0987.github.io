        FINAL PROJECT
    </h1>
        <p>
           This is my collaborative final project for CSC 106.
        </p>
            <br>
        <p>
            This project is a simple side-scrolling bullet hell game in which you take control of a small biplane and attempt to dodge comically oversized munitions headed your way!

    <h2>
        THE STORY:
    </h2> 
        <p>
            <br>
            It is February, 1949. The German Reich has won the Second World War, and the Soviet Union has fallen far, with the Germans taking territory up to Moscow 
            and the Japanese taking territory in Siberia. 
            <br>
            There seems to be little hope left for the state to continue functioning.
        </p>
            <br>
        <p>
            However, recent events (mainly the death of The Fuhrer himself) have given Soviet resistance members a chance to band together and strike back at their oppressors. 
            You are a spy pilot for the resistance, and have just finished a mission stealing blueprints from the German Reich that are planning create a nuclear weapon. 
            You must bring these blueprints to headquarters, but right as you take off, you are assaulted by newly-operational German missile systems that span for miles in 
            the snow.
        </p> 
            <br>
        <p>
            Can you survive the onslaught of hundreds of missiles and bring the plans back to the Motherland?
