                <br>
                <p>Hello there! My name is <strong>Jay</strong>; I'm a computer science major and IT Service Desk Consultant at the University of Rhode Island. </p>
        <p>I believe this website to be a stepping stone of sorts into something much greater. As my first website, this will be extremely barebones for now and be updated 
            at varying intervals in terms of functionality and, depending on my programming skill, may turn into a greater, more aesthetically appealing endeavor.
                </p>
            <br>
                <p>
            You can learn more about me by clicking on the "About Me" button!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Likewise, my Javascripts can be found by clicking on the "Javascripts" button.
                </p>
                    <br>
            This website currently only features limited functionality and several buttons to switch to different pages. I will add more stylization to this website in the near future.
