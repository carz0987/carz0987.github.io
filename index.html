        <p>Hello there! My name is Jay; I'm a computer science major and IT Service Desk Consultant at the University of Rhode Island. </p>
        <p>I believe this website to be a stepping stone of sorts into something much greater. Ever since middle school, I have developed a profound love for technology and 
            its breakneck advancement in the modern era.
